Performance is just as much a part of user experience as typography, color, and layout. Users today expect seamless, instant interactions, and even a slight delay can lead to frustration, drop-offs, and lost revenue. Google research suggests that pages should load in under 2.5 seconds for an optimal experience, but many websites and apps still struggle to meet this benchmark.","In my experience as a design engineer, UI performance is often treated as an afterthought—something to optimize once the product is already built. This approach is flawed. Performance should be considered from the very first design decisions. A fast UI feels effortless, while a sluggish one frustrates users before they even fully understand the product.","One of the most common performance issues in React applications is unnecessary re-renders. When a component re-renders too frequently, it can slow down the UI, especially if it’s part of a large, interactive application.","To solve this, we can use memoization techniques like React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Another common optimization is lazy loading, which defers loading of components until they are actually needed.","Here’s an example of how to improve rendering performance in a React application:","In this example, we’re implementing three key optimizations:","Lazy Loading (lazy & Suspense)Instead of loading HeavyComponent immediately, it is loaded only when needed. This helps reduce initial page load time.","Memoization with useMemoThe expensive calculation (multiplying count * 2) is only recalculated when count changes. Without useMemo, it would be re-evaluated on every render, which is inefficient.","Preventing Unnecessary Re-renders with useCallback & React.memo","The handleChange function is memoized with useCallback to prevent it from being recreated on every render.","The entire ParentComponent is wrapped in React.memo, ensuring it only re-renders when props change, rather than unnecessarily updating due to state changes in unrelated parts of the app.","Performance bottlenecks can come from a variety of sources, and they often sneak up on teams as features are added and designs evolve. One of the most common culprits is unoptimized assets, such as oversized images, excessive fonts, and redundant CSS or JavaScript files. Many designers forget to optimize images for different screen sizes, resulting in users downloading files much larger than necessary.","Another major issue is frequent and unnecessary DOM updates. Every time a web page reflows, the browser recalculates the layout and repaints elements, which can lead to stuttering animations and delayed interactions. This is particularly common in applications with complex UI states, such as dashboards or interactive forms.","JavaScript execution also plays a crucial role in UI speed. As the codebase grows, inefficient scripting can slow down rendering times. This is especially true in modern JavaScript-heavy applications, where frequent re-renders and blocking operations cause lag.","Animations and transitions, if not optimized properly, can also degrade the experience. While animations make interfaces feel more polished and interactive, poorly implemented effects can lead to choppy interactions. This often happens when CSS animations rely on properties like top, left, or width, which force the browser to recalculate the entire layout rather than leveraging GPU acceleration.","The best way to create a fast UI is to design for performance from the start. This means making conscious choices about assets, layout, and how the application interacts with the browser’s rendering engine.","Optimizing images is one of the easiest and most effective ways to speed up a UI. Converting PNGs and JPEGs to WebP can significantly reduce file sizes while maintaining high quality. Implementing lazy loading ensures that images below the fold don’t load until they’re needed, reducing initial page load time.","To prevent excessive layout shifts and repaints, it’s important to define fixed dimensions for images and avoid making unnecessary changes to the DOM. In interactive applications, debouncing expensive UI operations—such as search queries or infinite scrolling—can prevent the UI from feeling sluggish.","When working with JavaScript-heavy applications, using techniques like code splitting and memoization in frameworks like React can drastically improve perceived speed. By reducing the number of unnecessary component re-renders, the interface remains responsive even as the app scales.","Finally, animations should be carefully designed to use GPU-accelerated properties like transform and opacity. Rather than modifying left or width, leveraging translate3d() ensures that animations remain smooth, even on lower-end devices.","UI performance isn’t just about making a product feel fast—it’s about creating an experience that feels seamless and natural. When a UI is well-optimized, users don’t even notice it; it simply works. But when performance is poor, it becomes an obstacle, preventing users from achieving their goals.","By thinking about performance as an integral part of both design and development, we can build products that aren’t just visually stunning, but also fast, responsive, and a joy to use.","More","07/02/26","Test Test","01/01/25","Hello world","11/01/25","Design tokens 101","12/02/25","How AI is changing my workflow","21/02/25","How to think like both a designer & engineer","Tbilisi, Georgia","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/writing/ui-performance"},"/":{"version":1,"title":"Saba Chitaishvili","description":"","keywords":"","h1":[],"h2":[],"h3":[],"h4":[],"h5":[],"h6":[],"p":["Open to work","3:01:16 GMT+4","Saba Chitaishvili","Design Systems Designer","TBC","Details to be added","Implemented design tokens system with more than 300 tokens across 5 themes","Built a scalable color system with the accessibility and system in mind","Set up a federative structure and contribution model for a multi-brand design system","2021 — Now","Design system designer","at","As a Product Designer at TBC, I focus on Design Systems—designing and maintaining UI component libraries, evolving the system, creating clear documentation, and driving adoption through collaboration with cross-functional teams.
